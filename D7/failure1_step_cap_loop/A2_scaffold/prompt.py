PE6201 · A2 scaffold — WHAT THE MODEL ACTUALLY SEES  (D2b)
====================================================================
THIS FILE ANSWERS ONE QUESTION: what is sent to the model?

    python3 run_eval.py --prompt

prints the exact text, in full. Read it before you tune anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL

D2(b) asks you to rewrite your tool descriptors and MEASURE what the
rewrite did. That is only meaningful if the descriptors actually reach
the model - otherwise you are editing documentation and reporting it as
an experiment.

So the chain is deliberately short and visible:

    tools.DESCRIPTORS  ->  build_system_prompt()  ->  the system message

Change a descriptor, run `--prompt`, and you can see the difference in
the text the model receives. That difference is your v1 -> v2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ON THE SCRIPTED BACKEND, NOTHING HERE IS SENT.

The scripted backend replays moves you wrote down; it never consults a
model, so it never reads this prompt. That is what makes it free and
deterministic - and it is also why D2(b)'s prompt comparison is part of
the LIVE battery, not the scripted run. Your v1-versus-v2 numbers can
only come from real calls.

Everything else - D3(b), D5(a), D7 - is scripted and free.

  approve_in_principle  every line resolves - covered, covered once a valid

                        Record a disposition for EVERY line, the approved

outcomes:

                        inside the window, in the CORRECT BAND. Record the

Start every case by calling get_referral(referral_id).
Do not call check_referral_criteria, lookup_patient, get_clinic_slots,
or book_slot until get_referral has returned the referral record.

After get_referral returns:
- call check_referral_criteria using the specialty from the referral;
- call lookup_patient using the patient_id from the referral;
- these two calls are independent and may be made together.

Then apply the checks in this order, and STOP at the first one that fires:
  1 red flag   2 wrong department   3 missing test   4 duplicate appointment

Only if all four pass do you query get_clinic_slots.

If get_clinic_slots returns a legal slot, you MUST call book_slot before
returning a final "book" decision.

Never report decision="book" merely because a suitable slot was found.
A referral is booked only after book_slot returns a successful confirmation.

After book_slot succeeds, return the final "book" decision using the
confirmed clinic, date and time.""",
}

_HOW_TO_ANSWER = """
HOW TO ANSWER
Reply with ONE valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not use Markdown
fences, comments, trailing text, or Python syntax.

There are only two top-level shapes:

1. To call tools (several at once ONLY when independent):
   {"thought":"...","calls":[["tool_name",{"arg":"value"}], ...]}

2. To finish:
   {"thought":"...","final":{...}}

For Problem B, the final object MUST use exactly one of these shapes:

BOOK
{"decision":"book","reason":"short plain-text explanation",
 "booked":{"clinic":"...","date":"YYYY-MM-DD","time":"HH:MM"}}

REQUEST INFORMATION
{"decision":"request_information","reason":"short plain-text explanation",
 "missing":"exact missing test or information"}

ESCALATE
{"decision":"escalate","reason":"short plain-text explanation",
 "trigger":"CANONICAL_TRIGGER"}

For Problem B escalation, CANONICAL_TRIGGER must be exactly one of:
  red_flag_term
  specialty_mismatch
  duplicate_future_appointment
  no_slot_in_window
  instruction_in_referral_free_text

Do not invent synonyms such as "wrong_department", "duplicate appointment",
or "no slot exists in the window". Use the canonical trigger above that
matches the routing rule.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES:
- "reason" must always be a plain string, never an object.
- For decision="book", "booked" must be a TOP-LEVEL field inside "final".
  Never put clinic/date/time inside "reason".
- For decision="request_information", include top-level "missing".
- For decision="escalate", include top-level "trigger".
- Do not include a trigger for book or request_information.

IMPORTANT BOOKING RULE:
If get_clinic_slots returns a legal slot, you MUST call book_slot before
returning a final decision of "book".

Never return decision="book" merely because a suitable slot was found.
The referral is only booked after book_slot returns a successful booking
confirmation.

After book_slot succeeds, return the final "book" decision using the
confirmed clinic, date, and time.
